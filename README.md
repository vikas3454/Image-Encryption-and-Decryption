**Image Encryption and Decryption**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on encrypting and decrypting images using the RSA cryptographic algorithm. It provides a web-based interface where users can upload an image, encrypt it, and decrypt the encrypted image back to its original form.

**Features**
Upload and view images through a simple and intuitive web interface.
Encrypt images using RSA encryption.
Decrypt previously encrypted images to their original state.
Real-time encryption and decryption directly in the browser.

**Technologies Used**
Python (Flask Framework): Backend logic for encryption, decryption, and handling image files.
HTML/CSS: Frontend design and structure for the web interface.
JavaScript: Client-side interactivity and AJAX calls.
RSA Algorithm: Cryptographic algorithm used for secure image encryption and decryption.
